# Learning C++
**Disclaimer. All the instructions here are taken from the internet with bit of my vision.**

This is my effort to learn C++. I will be very glad to receive comments and suggestions for improvement in the code.

In this course, We have covered very 
1. Basic concepts
2. Object oriented programming
3. Inheritance
4. Loops, if else statements
5. Iterators

**TIPS**
1. Key binding to auto align the code is:
```
On Windows Shift + Alt + F
On Mac Shift + Option + F
On Ubuntu Ctrl + Shift + I
```
2. 

**General Information**
- #include <file> When you use angle brackets, as in #include <file> , the compiler searches for the header file in the standard system directories
- #include "file" When you use double quotes, as in #include "file" , the compiler first searches for the header file in the current directory.
