# Learning C++
**Disclaimer. All the instructions here are taken from the internet with bit of my vision.**

This is my effort to learn C++. I will be very glad to receive comments and suggestions for improvement in the code.

In this course, I have covered very **basic concepts** and the advanced **Object oriented programming** content. W have also talked about inheritance. We have talked about **loops, if else statements as well.**
